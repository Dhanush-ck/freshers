# Freshers Page

This is a page for the students to enter their name and login. When conducting a program there is a issue in selecting a random person from the crowd. The person will think that the anchor is targeting them. To solve this issue I made this page to technically select a random person. People can enter their name and register their names to the page.

## Features
- Add names (No repeated name allowed)
- Select random user
- Only authorised user can select the random user
- No repeated selection
- Manage already selected users
- List all the user filter based on the year
- List how many are selected among the total
